- (maybe) add support to more complex paths
- in some places code still behaves like there were both number and range inputs
- the state of the webpage should be saved

- BIG UPDATE COMING SOON:
  - by default there is no path
  - user can choose between ellipsis, cubic and quadratic bezier
  - if user chose a bezier they can add more points to make it longer (the same bezier)
